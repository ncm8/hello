When Noel is not studying or working she likes to live life to the fullest. As a person who has never quite identified just one hobby she enjoys trying new experiences. Finding festivals and events to partake in, around the Cleveland area, is one of her favorite things to do. She also enjoys kayaking, dancing, baking, and the occasional crafting.
